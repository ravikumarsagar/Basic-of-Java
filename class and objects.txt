-->A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method, is known as instance variable.

-->Local variables - Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables.

Class variables - Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.
-->a method is like function i.e. used to expose behavior of an object.

Advantage of Method
Code Reusability
Code Optimization

The new keyword is used to allocate memory at run time.

There are 3 ways to initialize object in java.

-By reference variable
-By method
-By constructor

-->>Initializing object simply means storing data into object.

--We can also create multiple objects and store information in it through reference variable.

--->>There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:

By new keyword
By newInstance() method
By clone() method
By deserialization
By factory method etc.

-->Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.

-->>Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.
--it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.


Advantage of java inner classes--
1.it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.
2.Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only
3.Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.


Difference between nested class and inner class in Java
--Inner class is a part of nested class. Non-static nested classes are known as inner classes.


There are two types of nested classes non-static and static nested classes.

--
Non-static nested class (inner class)
1.Member inner class
2.Anonymous inner class
3.Local inner class


~~simple defination~~

Member Inner Class	--A class created within class and outside method.
Anonymous Inner Class	--A class created for implementing interface or extending class. Its name is decided by the java compiler.
Local Inner Class	--A class created within/inside method.
Static Nested Class	--A static class created within/inside a class.
Nested Interface	--An interface created within class or interface.

Java Member inner class
A non-static class that is created inside a class but outside a method is called member inner class.

Java static nested class
-- It cannot access non-static data members and methods. It can be accessed by outer class name.
--It can access static data members of outer class including private.
--Static nested class cannot access non-static (instance) data member or method


Points to remember for nested interfaces
There are given some points that should be remembered by the java programmer.

--Nested interface must be public if it is declared inside the interface but it can have any access modifier if declared within the class.
--Nested interfaces are declared static implicitely.

Abstract class in Java
A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body).

-->The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:

variable
method
class

Java final class
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.
