Interface in Java

points to remember--

An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
a class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface.


Why use Java interface?
There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.

It is used to achieve abstraction.
By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
All the methods are public and abstract. And all the fields are public, static, and final.

An interface can have another interface i.e. known as nested interface
Abstract class and interface both are used to achieve abstraction where we can declare the abstract methods


why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?

The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are final, public and static.

Extending Interfaces
The extends keyword is used to extend an interface, and the child interface inherits the methods of the parent interface.

Extending Multiple Interfaces
A Java class can only extend one parent class.
