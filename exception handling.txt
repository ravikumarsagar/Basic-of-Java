 Checked Exception
The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known 
as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

Unchecked Exception
The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. 
ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, 
but they are checked at runtime.
