When a class has two or more methods by the same name but different parameters, 
it is known as method overloading.

In overriding, a method has the same method name, type, number of parameters, etc.

Java has three different types of methods.--

1. Static methods: A static method is a method that can be called and executed without creating an object. 
In general, static methods are used to create instance methods.
Static method can be invoked directly via class name i.e.; 
we don't have to create an object for a class in order to initiate static method.

2.Instance methods: These methods act upon the instance variables of a class. 
Instance methods are classified into two types--

a.Accessor methods: These are the methods which read the instance variables i.e.; 
just go access the instance variables data. 
Generally these methods are named by prefixing with "get".

b. Mutator method: These are the methods, which not only read the instance variables 
but also modify the data. Generally these methods are named by prefixing with "set".

3. Factory methods: A factory method is a method that returns an object to the class to which it belongs.
 All factory methods are static methods.
